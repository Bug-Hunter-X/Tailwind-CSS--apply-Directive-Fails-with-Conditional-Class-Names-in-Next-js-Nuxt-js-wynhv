This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js, and involves the `@apply` directive.  The issue arises when applying utility classes conditionally, often within a loop or conditional rendering.  The classes might not apply correctly, resulting in unexpected styling or no styling at all. This is because the `@apply` directive works during the build process and needs to be able to access all the necessary class names at compile time.  In conditional rendering scenarios, some class names might not be available during the build stage, leading to the failure to apply styles. For instance:

```javascript
{/** @jsx jsx */}
import { jsx } from 'react/jsx-runtime';

function MyComponent() {
  const items = ['red', 'blue', 'green'];

  return (
    <div>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <div className={`bg-${item}-500 p-4`} key={item}>
          Item {item}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this case, the `bg-${item}-500` might not apply correctly if the compiler can't resolve the dynamic class names.
